HashSet in Java:
-------------------
HashSet class uses a hash table for storing the elements.

It implements the set interface.

Duplicate values are not allowed.

Before storing any object, the hashset uses the hashCode() and equals() method to check any duplicate entry in the hash table.
Allows null value.

Best suited for search operations.


Constructors Of HashSet :
--------------------------
HashSet(): This constructor is used to create a new empty HashSet that can store 16 elements and have a load factor of 0.75.

HashSet(int initialCapacity): This constructor is used to create a new empty HashSet which has the capacity to store the specified number of elements and having a load factor of 0.75.

HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor): This constructor is used to create a new empty HashSet with the capacity & load factor equal to specified integer and float value.

HashSet(Collection<? extends E> c): This constructor is used to create a HashSet using the elements of collection c.
