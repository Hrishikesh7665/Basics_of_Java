There are three types of errors in java, which is:
---------------------------------------------------
1) Syntax errors

2) Logical errors

3) Runtime errors- also called Exceptions

N.B: In Exceptions we will only work with Runtime errors.


Syntax Errors:
-------------- 
When complex finds something wrong with our program, it throws a syntax error.

Example:
---------

int   a = 9  // No semicolon, syntax errors!
a =   a + 3;
d = 4; // Variable not declared, syntax errors


Logical Errors:
----------------
A logical error or a bug occurs when a program compiles and round but does the wrong thing.

Example:
---------

int x = 0;
x = x + 1;
System.out.println("X = " + x);


Runtime Errors:
----------------
Java may sometimes encounter an error while the program is running, These are also called Exceptions!
These are encountered due to circumstances like bad input and (or) resource constraints.

Ex: User supplies 'S' + 8 to a program that adds 2 numbers.
Syntax errors and logical errors are encountered by the programmers, whereas Run-time errors are encountered by the users.
