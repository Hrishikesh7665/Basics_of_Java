The interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code. On the other hand, the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code.

Interpreter :
----------------
one statement at a time.
An interpreter is needed every time.
Partial execution if an error occurs in the program.
Easy for programmers.


Compiler :
-----------------
Entire program at a time.
Once compiled, it is not needed.
No execution if an error occurs.
Usually not as easy as interpreted once.


Notes:
----------
Java is a hybrid language both compiled as well as interpreted.

A JVM can be used to interpret this bytecode
can be taken to any platform ( win/ mac / Linux ) for education.
Hence, java is platform-independent ( write once run everywhere ).
