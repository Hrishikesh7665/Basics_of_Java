/*
An array is a collection of similar types of data having contiguous memory allocation.
The indexing of the array starts from 0., i.e 1st element will be stored at the 0th index, 2nd element at 1st index, 3rd at 2nd index, and so on.
The size of the array can not be increased at run time therefore we can store only a fixed size of elements in array.
