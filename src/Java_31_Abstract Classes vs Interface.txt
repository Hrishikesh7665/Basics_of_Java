Abstract Classes Vs Interfaces
---------------------------------

No. 1
-------
Abstract class :  It can contain abstract and non-abstract method.

Interface      :  It can only contain abstract methods. We do not need to use the "abstract" keyword in interface methods because the interface is implicitly abstract.


No. 2
-------
Abstract class :  Abstract keyword is used to declare an abstract class.

Interface      :  Interface keyword is used to declare an interface.


No. 3
-------
Abstract class :  A subclass extends the abstract class by using the "extends" keyword.

Interface      :  The "implements" keyword is used to implement an interface.


No. 4
-------
Abstract class :  A abstract class in Java can have class members like private, protected, etc. 

Interface      :  Members of a Java interface are public by default. 


No. 5
-------
Abstract class :  Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.

Interface      :  Multiple inheritance is achieved in Java by using the interface.
